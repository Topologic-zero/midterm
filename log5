In this lab, I explored how the client-server model and HTTP communication work using an ESP32 board. I began by flashing MicroPython firmware and connecting the board to WiFi. Two LEDs were used to indicate power and WiFi status, which made debugging easier. After connecting successfully, I wrote a script that turned the ESP32 into a basic web server. When I entered its IP address into a browser, it responded with a simple HTML page. This was a great demonstration of how HTTP requests and responses are handled in real time by a small embedded system. I now understand how sockets listen for connections and how servers respond. Seeing hardware, networking, and code working together was rewarding. This lab gave me hands-on insight into how IoT devices can serve content and interact with users through web interfaces.
