Reflection – Lab 7: Python IoT Controller / MQTT Home Automation
In this lab, I learned how to make a small smart-home system using Python. I also learned about something called MQTT. MQTT is a way for devices to send messages to each other. One device can send a message, and another device can listen and do something when it gets that message.

At first, it was a little confusing. I had to set up something called a broker. The broker is like a mailman who delivers messages between devices. Then I wrote Python code to send messages (publish) and to get messages (subscribe). When I finally saw the messages going back and forth, I felt proud. It helped me understand how real smart-home devices work.

My favorite part was seeing the messages show up right away. It showed me that MQTT is fast and simple. Python also made the code easy to read.

The hardest part was fixing mistakes. Sometimes nothing worked, and I didn’t know why. I had to check my topic names and make sure everything was connected. This taught me to be patient and to double-check my work.

Overall, this lab taught me a lot about how devices can talk over the internet. It was fun to see how Python and MQTT can control things without wires. I think this will help me in future robotics and automation projects.
