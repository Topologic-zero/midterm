At the beginning of Lab 9, I was a little scared by the concept of melding MQTT streams with a Flask dashboard, but I was already feeling the pride of what I had built by the end of it. Integrating the MQTT client into Flask had me considering real-world issues: disconnections, the way of defining topics, and how to make the UI experience good without the browser being overwhelmed with data. One of the things I really liked was the process of converting raw sensor data into graphical images that are easy to understand, and I also learned to select the proper visuals that indeed help one in the detection of trends. There were moments of frustration during the debugging of race conditions and timing issues, but at each minor fix I was able to develop better logging and testing habits. The instant when I saw the live data flowing into my dashboard was very satisfying - theoretical ideas turned into something I could click on and explore. For the future, I plan to add simple authentication, a lightweight database for holding historical queries and smarter update throttling so that the dashboard is smooth even on low-power devices. Lab 9 was not just a lesson on tools; it was a reminder of the fun I have when creating things that connect the real and the digital world. The iteration and enhancement of it is something I look forward to.
