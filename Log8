This lab taught me how to use Python and SQLite to store MQTT messages in a database. I was only able to send and receive messages in real time prior to this. However, I now know how to preserve the data for later review. Every message is recorded in SQLite, which functions similarly to a tiny digital notebook.

I developed a Python application that can listen to MQTT topics. When a message comes in, the program records the time, the message, and the topic in the database. Since actual IoT systems must store data, this is crucial. For instance, if a temperature sensor continues to provide readings, we would like to capture them in order to verify the events of the day. It gave the system a sense of completion. It now remembers messages instead of just responding to them.For me, the most challenging aspect was configuring the database tables and ensuring that the data was saved correctly.I had to use caution when writing the code, particularly when adding new rows. I occasionally mixed types or forgot to include a comma, which led to mistakes.

All things considered, this lab improved my comprehension of the "history" of IoT. It demonstrated to me that data storage is equally as crucial as device control. I believe that this ability will be helpful in upcoming robotics and automation projects.
