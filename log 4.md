Today’s lab was a fun and challenging experience that helped me connect Python programming with real-world hardware. I started by cloning a GitHub repository to my Raspberry Pi and setting up a virtual environment. After removing the text-to-speech code that doesn’t work on the Pi, I dug into the program and saw how each object created had its own unique ID, tracked by a class counter. The coolest part was building a binary counter with LEDs—connecting everything to the GPIO pins and watching numbers light up in binary was really satisfying. I had to troubleshoot some wiring issues and figure out the difference between physical and logical pin numbers, but it helped me learn a lot. I also cleaned up the code by adding a boolean to control speech output and used loops to replace repetitive lines. Overall, it was a great way to see how code and electronics work together.
